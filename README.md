ü™ë Furninder ‚Äî Find Similar Furniture Using AI
==============================================

Furninder is an AI-powered application that helps you find visually similar furniture items simply by uploading an image. Leveraging Google's **PaLI-Gemma** multimodal model, Furninder intelligently performs image-to-text conversion and then finds the closest matches based using clip embeddings.


‚ú® Features
----------

*   **Image-to-Image Search**: Find furniture that looks like the one in your photo.
    
*   **AI-Powered Similarity Matching**: Utilizes the advanced **PaLI-Gemma** model for accurate results.
    
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask for easy interaction.
    

üöÄ Setup Instructions
---------------------

Get Furninder up and running with these simple steps:

### 1\. Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Ensure you have Python version **3.8 or newer** installed.
    
*   **Hugging Face Account**: You'll need a Hugging Face account and a generated access token for model authentication.
    

### 2\. Clone the Repository

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4\. Hugging Face Authentication

If this is your first time using models from Hugging Face, you'll need to authenticate. This allows Furninder to download and use the PaLI-Gemma model. Run this command and follow the prompts:

huggingface-cli login
